=====================================================================
             This module is looking for a maintainer!

No one is maintaining this module, but you can take up its care
and feeding by requesting CPAN persmissions from modules@perl.org.

This version is assigned to the ADOPTME CPAN user and hosted in
GitHub:

	https://github.com/CPAN-Adopt-Me/mac-iphoto-shell

=====================================================================

You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

	perldoc Mac::iPhoto::Shell

The `iphoto-shell` script installs whereever you told the Makefile.PL
to install programs. Without a prefix that defauts to the value you
set up when you installed Perl. That is probably something like
/usr/bin or /usr/bin/perl.

If you want to read the source before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file.

	perldoc  lib/Mac/iPhoto/Shell.pm

This module is also in GitHub

You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	
The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

	perldoc Mac::iPhoto::Shell
	
The `iphoto-shell` script installs whereever you told the Makefile.PL
to install programs. Without a prefix that defauts to the value you
set up when you installed Perl. That is probably something like 
/usr/bin or /usr/bin/perl.

If you want to read the source before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file.

	perldoc  lib/Shell.pm
	
This module is also in CVS on SourceForge

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/brian-d-foy/
